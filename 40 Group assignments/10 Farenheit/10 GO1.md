# GO1 Farenheit

# Specification

The goal of this assignment is to create a program that can convert temperatures from Celcius to Farenheit.
In this assignment you learn how to create, compile and run a c-program.

# Getting started
## Create a Cloud9 workspace

Head to [cs50.io](https://cs50.io/) and log into CS50 IDE. You may be prompted (again) for your email address. If so, after providing it, click *Private* under *Hosted workspace*, then click *Create workspace*.
You should then be informed that CS50 IDE (aka Cloud9, the software that underlies CS50 IDE) is “creating your workspace” and “creating your container,” which might take a moment. You should eventually see your workspace, which should resemble mine from Week 1. If not, do just email the course’s heads to inquire!

## Update

Toward the bottom of CS50 IDE’s UI is a “terminal window” (light blue, by default), a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to explore your workspace’s files and directories, compile code, run programs, and even install new software. You should find that its “prompt” resembles the below:

```
    ~/workspace/ $
```

Click inside of that terminal window and then type:

```
    update50
```

followed by Enter to ensure that your workspace is up-to-date. It might take a few minutes for any updates to complete. (Be sure not to close the tab or CS50 IDE itself until they do!)
Next, execute:

```
    mkdir ~/workspace/GO1
```

at your prompt in order to make a directory called `GO1` in your `workspace` directory. Take care not to overlook the space between `mkdir` and `~/workspace/GO1` or any other character for that matter! Keep in mind that `~` denotes your home directory, `~/workspace` denotes a directory called `workspace` therein, and `~/workspace/GO1` denotes a directory called `GO1` within `~/workspace`.
Now execute

```
    cd ~/workspace/GO1
```

to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below:

```
    ~/workspace/GO1
```

## Create a new C-file

You can create a new file using the file browser tab. Under `filesystem`, click on the `workspace` directory to open it. Now right-click on the directory `GO1` and select `New File`. Give your file the name `farenheit.c`. Now double click on the file to open it.

## Edit

Let’s start with something simple. Let’s create a program that will print “Hello, world!”. Type the following code into the file:

```
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
    }
```

Now safe your file (ctrl-s).

## Compile

To compile the file `farenheit.c`, go to the terminal (below the file) and type the command below:

```
    make farenheit
```

This command will look for the file `farenheit.c` and compile it. If all is well, you should see an output similar to this:

```
    clang -fsanitize=integer -fsanitize=undefined -ggdb3 -O0 -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Wshadow    farenheit.c  -lcrypt -lcs50 -lm -o farenheit
```

This will create an executable file called `farenheit`. You can check this by typing the command below:

```
    ls
```

This will show all the existing files in the directory. The output should look something like this:

```
    farenheit*  farenheit.c
```

This shows two files: the file `farenheit.c` that you created yourself, and the file `farenheit` which was created by the make command. (The `*` at the end of the filename indicates that the file is executable).

## Run

You can now run your program, by typing the following command in the terminal:

```
    ./farenheit
```

This runs your program, and if it is written correctly it should produce the output:

```
    Hello, world!
```

# Assignment
## Farenheit

Now, the goal of this program is not to print “Hello, world!”. Your assignment is to write a program that converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit, as per the sample output below, wherein underlined text represents some user’s input.

```
    username@ide50:~/workspace/unit1 $ ./fahrenheit
    C: 100
    F: 212.0
```

The formula to compute degrees Celcius (C) to Farenheit (F) is F = ((C * 9) / 5) + 32.

To solve this problem, you needn’t do anything more complex than use your currently existing knowledge of C, and the information contained in this specification, including the temperature conversion formula. No matter how the user inputs the temperature in Celsius (that is, no matter to how many decimal places they choose), take care to display Fahrenheit to *exactly* one decimal place. No need to worry about floating-point imprecision or integer overflow, if you recall what those terms mean.

Bonus: The program now probably ends after one interaction. Can you make the program repeat the interaction? I.e., once the computer has taken the user input and converted it to Farenheit, it asks the user for a new input to convert. It continues to do so until the user enters a value of −274 or below.

# Tips
## User input

You will want to ask the user for input. There are inbuilt functions in c to do this, but CS50 has created a library to make this a little bit easier. You can include by adding the following line at the top of your file:

```
    #include <cs50.h> 
```

This library implements the functions `get_string()`, `get_int()`, and `get_float()`, which ask the user for an input of the corresponding datatype.

For example the program below asks the user to enter their name (a string), and ouputs “Hello, [name]!”.

```
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        printf("Enter your name: ");
        string name = GetString();
        printf("hello, %s\n", name);
    }
```

## Printing

Know that `printf` can be used to specify how many places after the decimal point you wish to display to the user. For example, assuming you’ve written the following program in a file called `truncate.c`:

```
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
       float pi = 3.1415926535;
       printf("%.2f\n", pi);
    }
```

When executed (by first compiling with `make truncate` and then executing with `./truncate`), this program will output the value of the variable `pi` to exactly 2 decimal places: `3.14`. Can you see why? Perhaps you can adapt that to display the converted temperature to just one decimal place?
